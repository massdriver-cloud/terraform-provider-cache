# Cache Provider

There are some narrow use-cases where its beneficial to cache (freeze) the initial value of a variable that may change in the future. For example, you may want to poll the AWS API for the most recent AMI, but you don't want to dynamically change the AMI of an instance to the most recent version every time terraform runs. Using the cache provider, you can fetch and save the most recent AMI at the first `apply`, then reference the `cache` when setting the AMI on the machine instance.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the cache provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cache = {
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
      source  = "massdriver-cloud/cache"
    }
  }
}

provider "cache" {}

resource "cache_store" "example" {
  value = "anything"
}

output "cache_value" {
  value = cache_store.example.value
}
```
